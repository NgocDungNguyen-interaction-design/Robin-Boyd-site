            <h2>About Robin Boyd</h2>
            <p>Robin Boyd CBE (1919–1971) was one of the most influential figures in Australian architecture. A visionary architect, author, critic, and public educator, Boyd was a leader in Melbourne’s Modern Architecture movement during the 1950s and 60s. He was deeply passionate about good design and dedicated his life to helping the public understand its importance.

                Boyd is best known for his bold ideas and his book The Australian Ugliness (1960), where he critiqued Australia’s suburban architecture and introduced the term “Featurism”—a focus on decorative details at the expense of cohesive design. He believed in pushing the boundaries of design thinking and encouraged Australians to move beyond the familiar and conventional.
                
                As the first Director of the Small Homes Service (1947–1953), Boyd helped make well-designed, affordable homes accessible to the general public. He also co-founded a major architectural firm with Roy Grounds and Frederick Romberg, designing over 200 projects throughout his career.
                
                In addition to his architectural work, Boyd was a gifted teacher and writer, publishing nine books and teaching at institutions such as the University of Melbourne and MIT. His legacy continues through the Robin Boyd Foundation, established in 2005 to promote design awareness and literacy.
                
                Boyd’s influence on Australian architecture and culture remains strong today—his work continues to inspire architects, designers, and anyone who believes in the power of thoughtful design.</p>
