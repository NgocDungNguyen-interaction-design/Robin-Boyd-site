# Robin Boyd Responsive Website

## Reflection

This project challenged me to turn a high-fidelity prototype into a fully functional, responsive website using HTML5 and CSS3. Overall, it was an insightful experience that allowed me to understand both the design and development aspects of front-end web creation.

One part I found relatively easy was gathering information about Robin Boyd and summarizing relevant content about his life and architectural legacy. This helped shape the structure of the content on the website.

However, the hardest part by far was writing the actual code. Implementing responsiveness using CSS media queries and especially creating the hamburger menu were very challenging for me, as I had never done anything like it before.

## Prototype Implementation

The prototype included a homepage with sections like About RB, Gallery, Key Words, and more. These sections were implemented as different areas of a single-page layout, with navigation links scrolling to each section. Some simplifications were made for technical feasibility, but the key structural components were retained.

## Use of Generative AI

I used ChatGPT to assist me in understanding difficult parts of this assignment. It helped me with HTML/CSS coding, implementing the hamburger menu, and understanding what “responsive design” actually means. The AI was especially useful when I needed help breaking down technical tasks that were unfamiliar to me.

## Lessons Learned

One major takeaway from this project is that building a website is not easy at all. There are many principles behind organizing code properly and ensuring that the website works across different screen sizes and devices. Honestly, it felt like I was programming a whole game at times! This experience has given me much more appreciation for web developers and the complexities involved in responsive design.

## Live Link

(If there is a chance to develop it into a real working website in the future, I will add a link to that website here later.)
